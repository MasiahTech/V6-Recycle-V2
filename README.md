🚮 Recycle System - Because the Ocean Has Enough Plastic Already

> "One man's trash is another man's... slightly better trash?"

A feature-packed recycling job for FiveM servers where players collect mysterious boxes and trade them for even more mysterious items. It's like a loot box, but with extra steps and questionable environmental practices.
🎯 Features

    📦 Box Collection - Pick up crates scattered around the map (they're not stolen, we promise)
    🔄 Smart Trading System - Trade recyclable materials for random rewards
    📈 Scaling Rewards - The more you trade, the better the loot (stonks 📊)
    💰 Resource Selling - Turn your hard-earned junk into cold hard cash
    🗺️ GPS Tracking - Blips show you where the boxes are (for the directionally challenged)
    🎨 Sleek UI - A fancy interface that's so transparent you can still see your poor FPS
    💾 Persistent Stats - Track your lifetime recycling efforts (flex on other trash collectors)

🎲 How It Works

    Start the Job - Talk to the NPC who definitely isn't running an illegal operation
    Collect Boxes - Follow the green blips to find mysterious crates
    Drop Off - Return boxes to get 1-3 recyclable materials each
    Trade Materials - Exchange materials for random items (gambling, but eco-friendly!)
    Sell Resources - Convert your rewards into money
    Profit??? - You're now a certified trash magnate

💡 Final Thoughts

Remember: In the grand scheme of things, we're all just picking up virtual trash in a virtual world while ignoring the real trash that needs picking up IRL. Stay hydrated and touch grass occasionally.

Happy Recycling! ♻️

P.S. - If you found a bug, that's not a bug, it's a feature. If it crashes your server, that's a feature too. If players exploit it... okay that one's on me, but I already said no support so... 🤷‍♂️.... If it's gamebreaking or serious I'll actually help you
